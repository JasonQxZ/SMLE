\title{Plots to visualize SMLE screening}
\usage{
\method{plot}{smle}(x, num_path = NULL, which_path = NULL, out_plot = 5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{'smle'} object as the output from \code{\link{SMLE}()}.}

\item{num_path}{Number of top coefficients to be shown.
Default is equal to the number of features retained in the model.}

\item{which_path}{A vector to control which features are shown in addition to the paths for the most significant coefficients.}

\item{out_plot}{A number from 1 to 5 indicating which plot is to be shown in the separate window; the default for solution path plot is "5".
See Description for plot labels 1-4.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the second plot.}
}
\value{
No return value.
}
\description{
This function returns two plot windows. By default, the first contains 4 plots to assess convergence:
1) log-likelihood,  
2) Euclidean distance between the current and the previous coefficient estimates,   
3) the number of tries in u-search (see details of \code{\link{SMLE}()}),  
and 4) the number of features changed in the current active set.
By default, the second plot shows the solution path (estimated coefficient by iteration step) for the retained features.
