}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class "formula" (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the model to be fitted.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to \code{smle_select()} if \code{selection=TRUE}. 
See \code{smle_select()} documentation for more details.}

\item{X}{The \eqn{n \times p} feature matrix with each column denoting a feature
(covariate) and each row denoting an observation vector. The input should be
the object of "matrix" for numerical data, and "data.frame" for categorical
data (or a mixture of numerical and categorical data). The algorithm will
treat covariates having class "factor" as categorical data and extend the data
frame dimension by the dummy columns needed for coding the categorical features.}

\item{Y}{The response vector of dimension \eqn{n \times 1}. Quantitative for
\code{family ='gaussian'}, non-negative counts for \code{family ='poisson'},
binary (0-1) for \code{family ='binomial'}. Input Y should be \code{'numeric'}.}

\item{data}{an optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables in the model.}

\item{k}{Total number of features (including \code{'keyset'}) to be retained 
after screening. Default is the largest integer not 
exceeding  \eqn{\frac{1}{2}\log(n)n^{1/3}}.}

\item{family}{Model assumption between Y and X; the default model is Gaussian
linear.}

\item{categorical}{Logical flag whether the input feature matrix includes
categorical features. If \code{categorical= TRUE}, a model intercept will
be used in the screening process. Default is NULL.}

\item{keyset}{A vector to indicate a set of key features that do not
participate in feature screening and are forced to remain in the model.
Default is null.}

\item{intercept}{A vector to indicate whether to an intercept be used in
the model. An intercept will not participate in screening.}

\item{group}{Logical flag for whether to treat the dummy covariates of a
categorical feature as a group. (Only for categorical data, see details).
Default is TRUE.}

\item{codingtype}{Coding types for categorical features; default is \code{'DV'}.
\code{Codingtype = "all"} Convert each level to a 0-1 vector.
\code{Codingtype = "DV"} conducts deviation coding for each level in
comparison with the grand mean.
\code{Codingtype = "standard"} conducts standard dummy coding for each level
in comparison with the reference level (first level).}

\item{Coef_initial}{A \eqn{p}-dimensional vector for the initial coefficient 
value of the IHT algorithm.  The default is to use Lasso with the sparsity 
closest to \eqn{n-1}.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iteration steps. Default is 500.}

\item{tol}{A tolerance level to stop the iteration, when the squared sum of
differences between two successive coefficient updates is below it.
Default is \eqn{10^{-2}}.}

\item{selection}{A logical flag to indicate whether an elaborate selection
is to be conducted by \code{smle_select} after screening.
 Default is FALSE. If TRUE, the function will return a '\code{selection}' object, 
 see \code{smle_select()} documentation for more details.}

\item{standardize}{Logical flag for feature standardization, prior to
performing (iterative) feature screening.  The resulting coefficients are
always returned on the original scale. Default is \code{standardize=TRUE}.
If features are in the same units already, you might not wish to
standardize.}

\item{fast}{Set to TRUE to enable early stop for SMLE-screening. It may help
to boost the screening efficiency with a little sacrifice of accuracy.
Default is FALSE, see details.}

\item{U_rate}{Decreasing rate in tuning step parameter \eqn{u^{-1}} in IHT
algorithm. See details.}

\item{penalize_mod}{A logical flag to indicate whether adjustment is used in
ranking groups of features. This augment is applicable only when
\code{categorical= TRUE} with \code{group=T}; the default is true:
a factor of \eqn{\sqrt{J}} is divided from the \eqn{L_2} effect of a group with J members.}
}

\item{I}{A list of iteration information.

\code{Y}: Same as input Y.

\code{CM}: Design matrix of class \code{'matrix'} for numeric features (or \code{'data.frame'} with categorical features).

\description{
Input a \eqn{n \times 1} response Y and a \eqn{n \times p} feature matrix X;
the function uses SMLE to retain only a set of \eqn{k<n} features that seem
to be most relevant for a GLM. It thus serves as a pre-processing step for an
elaborative analysis. In SMLE, the joint effects between features are naturally
accounted; this makes the screening more reliable. The function uses the
efficient iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm with step parameter
adaptively tuned for fast convergence. Users can choose to further conduct
an elaborative selection after SMLE-screening. See \code{smle_select()} for more details.
}
\details{
With the input Y and X, \code{SMLE} conducts joint feature screening by running
iterative hard thresholding algorithm (IHT), where the default initial value is set to
be the Lasso estimate with the sparsity closest to the sample size minus one.

In \code{SMLE}, the initial value for parameter \eqn{u^{-1}} is set to be
\eqn{\frac{1}{||X||^2_{\infty}}} and recursively decrease the value of 
\eqn{u^{-1}} by \code{U_rate} to guarantee the likelihood increment.

\code{SMLE} terminates IHT iterations when either \code{tol} or \code{max_iter} is
satisfied. When \code{fast=TRUE}, the algorithm also stops when the non-zero
members of the coefficient estimates remain the same for 10 successive
iterations or the log-likelihood difference between coefficient estimates is less
than 0.01 * the log-likelihood increase of the first step, or the 
\eqn{\sqrt{k}\cdot}\code{tol} is satisfied.

In \code{SMLE}, categorical features are coded by dummy covariates with the
method specified in \code{codingtype}. Users can use \code{group} to specify
whether to treat those dummy covariates as a single group feature or as
individual features.
When \code{group=TRUE} with \code{penalize_mod=TRUE}, the effect for a group
of \eqn{J} dummy covariates is computed by

\deqn{ \beta_i = \frac{1}{\sqrt{J}} \cdot \sqrt{(\beta_1)^2+...+(\beta_J)^2}}

which will be treated as a single feature in IHT iterations.

Since feature screening is usually a preprocessing step, users may wish to
further conduct an elaborative feature selection after screening. This can
be done by setting \code{selection=TRUE} in \code{SMLE()} or applying any existing
selection method on the output of \code{SMLE()}.
