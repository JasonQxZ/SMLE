\title{
Joint SMLE-screening for generalized linear models
}
\description{
Feature screening is a powerful tool in processing ultrahigh dimensional data. It attempts to screen
out most irrelevant features in preparation for a more elaborate analysis. This package provides an efficient implementation of SMLE-screening for linear, logistic, and Poisson models, where the joint effects among features are naturally incorporated in the screening process. The package also provides a function for conducting accurate post-screening feature selection based on an iterative hard-thresholding procedure and a user-specified selection criterion.

Input a \eqn{n \times 1} response vector Y and a \eqn{n \times p} predictor (feature) matrix X. The package outputs a set of \eqn{k < n} features that seem to be most relevant for joint regression. Moreover, the package provides a data simulator that generates synthetic datasets from high-dimensional GLMs, which accommodate both numerical and categorical features with commonly used correlation structures. \cr
